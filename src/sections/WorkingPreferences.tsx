            Our team prefers weekly physical meetings together, and we hope that this would be possible on our customers premises. 
            If that is not possible, we will figure out other solutions. Our team can work both in English and Finnish. Our team will use your practices and tools. 
            If you do not have preferences, we will give our recommendation to you in the beginning of cooperation.
